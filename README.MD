#About Linux LUGs
LinuxLUGs.com is a simple free and open-source directory for Linux User Groups (LUGs) and communities all around the world.

Using the site, you can find local Linux LUGs or communities and join the one(s) you're interested in to stay up to date with their meetups, activites, news and announcements.

You can also start/add your own LUG and invite members to join.
